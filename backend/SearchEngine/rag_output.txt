Okay, let’s break down what Shopify is, based on the documentation provided. Shopify is a platform that allows you to build and manage your own online store. It’s designed to be user-friendly, even if you have no prior experience with e-commerce. It’s a Platform for Selling: Shopify provides all the tools you need to list, sell, and manage your products online. No Inventory Needed: A key feature is the “dropshipping” model. With dropshipping, you don’t need to hold any inventory yourself. When a customer orders from your store, you purchase the product from a third-party supplier (like a manufacturer or wholesaler), and the supplier ships it directly to the customer. Easy Setup: You can set up your store quickly and easily.
